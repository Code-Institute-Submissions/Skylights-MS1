<h1><strong><u>SKYLIGHTS</strong></u></h1>

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

<h2><strong>UX</strong></h2>
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

<h2><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2>
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

<h2><strong>TECHNOLOGIES USED</strong></h2>
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

<h2><strong>DEPLOYMENT</strong></h2>
Development of my project was mainly through GitPod. I also used Visual Studio Code, whilst travelling for work, where internet access wasn't available.
<h2><strong>CREDITS</strong></h2>
<h3>Content</h3>
The text content for my project has been sourced from various sites. Mainly, Skylights <a href="https://twitter.com/SkylightsYRA">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skylights_yra">Instagram</a>, events website <a href="https://www.ents24.com/">Ents24</a> and the Spotify Skylights biography <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/66Gz29vqxLIyLZuBSUyJgP">page</a>. Other text material has been created by myself and although I have tried to be as accuate as possible, some things may not be 100% correct, such as dates etc.
<h3>Media</h3>
The photos used for my project were obtained from a few sources. The band photos were taken from Turnbull Smiths' Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/turnbull.smith">profile</a>. The event posters were obtained from <a href="https://www.ents24.com/">Ents24</a> and Skylights Official <a href="https://www.skylightsyra.co.uk/">website</a>.
<h2><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></h2>
I received inspiration for this project from <a href="https://bandzoogle.com/sample-band-sites">Bandzoogle</a>. I also Google searched a lot of popular band websites to see what content was available to their fans. I found almost all the websites I researched had a Discography section, which is why I included it in my project. I also liked that fans could purchase the bands songs through their websites, but that is beyond the scope of this project.
