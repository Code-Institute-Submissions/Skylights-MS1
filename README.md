<h1><strong><u>SKYLIGHTS</strong></u></h1>

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

<h2><strong>UX</strong></h2>
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

<h2><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2>
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea

<h2><strong>TECHNOLOGIES USED</strong></h2>
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap


<h2><strong>TESTING</strong></h2>

        <li>A host of web browsers.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>Google Chrome</li>
                <li>Firefox</li>

                <li>Internet Explorer 11</li>
                <li>Opera</li>
            </ul>
        <li>A range of different devices.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop PC</li>
                <li>Surface Pro 6</li>
                <li>Apple iPad</li>
                <li>Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro</li>
                <li>Huawei P30 Pro</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Contact Form/Ticket Modal</h3>
Displays errors when required fields have not been filled out. It also recognises if an invalid email address has been entered.

<h2><strong>BUGS</strong></h2>
Corrected bugs as development went on. All bugs that were found were mistyped elements or missing closing element tags.
HTML code ran through W3C HTML Validator and shows no errors.
CSS code ran through W3C CSS Validator and shows no errors.

<h2><strong>DEPLOYMENT</strong></h2>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
