<h1><strong>SKYLIGHTS</strong></h1>
<img src="/assets/images/AIR.JPG">
The purpose of this site is to showcase and inform users about an up-and-coming band called Skylights, who are based in Yorkshire, England. I have included a few of Skylights' most popular tracks, which should appeal to anybody who is into their Indie/Rock genres, but could extend to anybody who enjoys upbeat music with good vocals.
<h1><strong>Demo</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>The project has been deployed to Github. A live demo can be found <a href="https://byates1289.github.io/ms1/">here</a>, hosted on GitHub pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wireframes</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The wireframes used to help build my project can be found <a href="https://github.com/BYates1289/ms1/tree/master/assets/docs/MS1.pdf">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Colour Scheme</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I decided to do a contrasting grey colour scheme for my project. The website <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> helped me achieve this.
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Typography</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>'Roboto' is the main font thoughout this project with Sans Serif as the fallback font just in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I have used 'Special Elite' for the Headings and the logo font is 'Archivo Black.'</li>
        </ul>
    <li><strong>Images</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The large, black and white hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also fits in nicely with the theme of the website.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Nav Bar</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>A clean, responsive Bootstrap Nav Bar. Navigation links centre on mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Logo text resizes on smaller breakpoints to avoid Navbar Toggler icon moving underneath logo text.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Hero Image</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Reponsive band photo in black and white, which matches the colour theme of the rest of the website.</li>
    <li>Blockquote nested at the bottom of the photo. Quote from respected DJ, John Kennedy from Radio X.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Meet The Band</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>A brief introduction to the band and who their influences are. Fans of Oasis, Sex Pistols etc, will become intrigued and will want to learn more. Having celebrity followers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Warrington">Josh Warrington</a> and Leeds United manager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa">Marcelo Bielsa</a>, could also peak interest of their respective fans.</li>
    <li>Responsive individual photos of the band members, with hover affect showing the band members name and their role within the band.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Discography</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>A responsive Physical Chart table from June 2020 showing, in my opinion, Skylights biggest achievement to date. This is engaging for fans, especially when they Skylights above artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd">The Weeknd</a>, who has won 3x Grammy Awards and 8x Billboard Music Awards, to name but a few.</li>
    <li>A YouTube iFrame, that is fully responsive, showing a music video of Skylights latest single, Darkness Falls.</li>
    <li>Spotify iFrames, which show other songs by Skylights. They play a 30 second snippet, but contain a link to the full song on Spotify. The widths have been changed in different media queries so they are fully responsive.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Upcoming Events</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Responsive Bootstrap cards for upcoming events. Containing event information such as locations and dates.</li>
    <li>Buy Ticket modal containing purchase form. Bootstrap progress bar, displaying quantity of tickets remaining. No form action is called. Responsive and centered.</li>
    <li>Testimonials of people who have attended previous Skylights events. This could appeal to potential fans who live in the area and have not attended an event yet.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Bugs</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>I used Bootstrap 5 for my project, which meant Internet Explorer 11 or below would not be compatible. I wasn't too concerned by this, due to IE only having a 0.64% browser market share worldwide, as reported by <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/statistics/browser-market-share">Oberlo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Deployment</strong></h1>
The development of my project was through GitPod. The project was deployed onto GitHub Pages. To achieve this, I carried out the following steps:
    <ol>
        <li>I logged into GitHub and selected <i>Repositories</i>. I then selected <i>New</i> to create my new Repository.</li>
        <li>I named my Repository "MS1" (Milestone 1), and selected the Code Institute <i>Repository Template</i>, so that I didn't need to download any extra Extensions within GitPod.</li>
        <li>I then selected <i>Create Repository</i>, ensuring this was also set to <i>Public</i>.</li>
        <li>Once the repository was created, I then went to <i>Settings</i> and scrolled down to <i>Pages</i>.
        <li>I changed the <i>Source</i> from <i>None</i> to <i>Master</i>, then selected <i>Save</i>.
        <li>After a few minutes, my page was then visable when browsing via the unique GitHub link, shown in the <i>Pages</i> section.</li>
    </ol>
<h1><strong>Research</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>My research for this project consisted of Google searching many popular bands website and seeing what content they displayed for their fans. I also found the website, <a href="https://bandzoogle.com/sample-band-sites">Bandzoogle</a>, very helpful.</li>
