<h1><strong><u>SKYLIGHTS</strong></u></h1>

<h2><strong>UX</strong></h2>

This project was built to try and promote an up and coming band called Skylights, who are quite popular in the county of Yorkshire, England.

Whilst researching band websites, I felt more engaged with a single page site so I decided that was what I was going to do. I feel the structure and navigation works well.

I decided to use a grey themed website. I decided to do this because a lot of the Skylights social media photos are black and white so I thought this would work well. I used https://coolors.co/ to find the exact colours I wanted to use.

The website is fully responsive and works exactly as expected on all devices I have tested.

<h2><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2>

The Hero Image, contains a blockquote, which scales with the image. Font sizes change also, depending on screen size.

The About section gives a little bit of a background into the band, with photos of each member, who can be easily identified whilst hovering over the image.

The Discography section shows the bands most popular songs. It also includes a full length music video from their latest song "Darkness Falls".
The reason I included music was to try and engage potential fans who may not have heard of Skylights before.

The Events section shows posters of upcoming events. These were created using Bootstrap cards. 
It also includes a Buy Tickets modal, which brings up a form consisting of personal details, ticket selection and quantities as well as some information regarding the event and ticket availability. I have also included some user stories from fans which have attended past Skylights events.

The Contact Us form includes personal details, a catagory drop down list and a free text field. All fields with an asterix are required before the message is sent. (There is no action called when the button is pressed.)

In the Footer section, I have included a "Back to Top" arrow icon, which scrolls the user back to the top of the page. I feel this improves the user expe

<h3>Content</h3>
The text content for my project has been sourced from various sites. Mainly, Skylights <a href="https://twitter.com/SkylightsYRA">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skylights_yra">Instagram</a>, events website <a href="https://www.ents24.com/">Ents24</a> and the Spotify Skylights biography <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/66Gz29vqxLIyLZuBSUyJgP">page</a>. Other text material has been created by myself and although I have tried to be as accuate as possible, some things may not be 100% correct, such as dates etc.
<h3>Media</h3>
The photos used for my project were obtained from a few sources. The band photos were taken from Turnbull Smiths' Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/turnbull.smith">profile</a>. The event posters were obtained from <a href="https://www.ents24.com/">Ents24</a> and Skylights Official <a href="https://www.skylightsyra.co.uk/">website</a>.
<h2><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></h2>
I received inspiration for this project from <a href="https://bandzoogle.com/sample-band-sites">Bandzoogle</a>. I also Google searched a lot of popular band websites to see what content was available to their fans. I found almost all the websites I researched had a Discography section, which is why I included it in my project. I also liked that fans could purchase the bands songs through their websites, but that is beyond the scope of this project.
